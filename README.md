# landslide-modelling-and-inversion
This repo contains tutorials and codes regarding synthetic landslide data model for inversion using Electrical resistivity tomography as geophysical method for landslide monitoring and detection. This method allow us to test endless scenarios because researching the best landslide detection methods, relying on examples from previous studies is inefficient. The subsoil and surface characteristics vary greatly between sites, allowing the techniques to work at one but not at another. Furthermore, this method is restricted to previously known site conditions. Although physical and geotechnical testing, as well as lithostratigraphic core drilling, are options, they are frequently impractical or, at the very least, cost prohibitive for every site condition. As a result, modeling allows for the low-cost variation of site conditions, subsoil conditions.
